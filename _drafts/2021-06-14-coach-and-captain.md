In one of the companies I worked in, like many others I've also worked in, Team Lead's were responsible for technical direction, 
delivery and their direct reports. 
This lead to an incredible work load for the Team Leads, multiple of whom resigned, so we decided to experiment with implementing Team and 
Technical leads within the same team to combat the workload. This is how it went (from the Tech Lead's perspective).
I call this "Coach and Captain".


**The previous role of the Team Lead**

All of our teams had a Team Lead. This was a developer who had moved into a management position. 
All the developers in a team reported to the Team Lead. 
This person was not only a line-manager, expected to have regular one-to-ones with everyone in their team, but also was responsible for:
 * Architecture & technical product direction,
 * Software Product delivery and co-ordination of work across the different products - working with Product Managers,
 * Technical mentorship to improve skills & practices,
 * Team & Department people-related management.

    
We had fairly large teams. My team was between 6-8 people over the span of 2 years. 
This size actually worked well for us as we maintained all of our own infrastructure, wrote and deployed all our own code and were on-call for everything we built.
The team leads used modern management practices like one-one-ones to ensure they were providing personal time to each team members.
They were also: 
 * in every meeting about work planning, updates, story creation, team logistics & recruitment, 
 * talking with users & clients, 
 * researching technology, tools & vendors, 
 and the list goes on. 
There were many scenarios where the Team Lead was simply not available to the team.
"So the seniors were available weren't they?". Half our team was senior and each person had their own ideas about direction
and implementation choices, which took time to resolve and often involved the lead's input to finalise.
Three Team Leads reached breaking point and resigned within a few weeks of each other.

**Introducing Tech Leads**

Clearly the stress of taking on all that responsibility caused our leaders to burn out.
Management made the decision to split the line management and technical responsibilities (better late than never?).
Each team would have a Technical Lead as well as a Team Lead. The Tech Lead would take on the Technical Strategy & Direction, 
tooling & practice oversight and, in my team, career-development work.
The Team Lead would remain the line manager and main communication person.
The tri-vector was completed with the Product Manager whom was responsible for Product direciton, priorities and business comms.
Between the three roles, besides over Christmas, there was to be delivery and communication continuity. 
In simplistic terms the What was owned by the PM, the When by the Team Lead and the How by the Tech Lead.

**Our Coach and Captain**

Our Team Lead was not a coder. They had run their own start-up for a technical product but were not involved in building it. 
It reminded me a lot of a coach role. Standing on the sidelines, looking at the wider game in play. They made sure the things the PM wanted to happen were co-ordinated.
They participated and guided in the realm of our Software Products and understood what helped the products get 
delivered but didn't actually 'play' with the team 'on the field'.
They made sure to  actively listen to each person, providing advice on personal well-being and 
generally taking care of them within the organisation. They were a good communicator and their experience in navigating politics 
(which exists everywhere, let's not kid ourselves) 
and understanding priorities in the broader context of the wider business, greatly helped the team understand the context and true impact of thier work.
They were also a good mediator and worked with each person to improve their ability to work within a team.
The Tech Lead 'played on the field' with the team. 
The Tech Lead sat with the team almost all week, was available for reviews, oversight, direction and judgement calls. 
Unlike the previous Team Lead who was bogged down with management and logistics, the Tech Lead was much more available which means 
decisions were made more quicly, work unblocked and technical re-direction was able to happen rapidly.
Technical direction and ways of working were important in this role and I encouraged a lot of collaborative practices like pairing or ensembling where the team felt comfortable doing so.

"So you get to do all the fun stuff while the manager does the boring work"? I was asked this more crudely in a talk. In some senses, yes, but by no means did i not deal with people.
As with any role, the longer you work, the better your communication needs to be if you want to get anything done in any organisation.

**What did the team think?**

As this Team and Tech Lead worked well together, the team enjoyed the leadership configuration because they felt that their needs as people and technologists were able to be addressed.
The team's motivation and output improved greatly overall. The Tech Lead availability sped up technical work. 
Some decisions were more clearly scoped for the Team or Tech Lead but others were not which required the other to be consulted.
This did not burdon us greatly as the Leads communicated daily if not more than that, but its worth calling out.
It is clear that if there is not trust between the 2 Leads, this configuration could greatly slow a team's delivery speed. 
Luckily in our case, this trust was in place and the 2 Lead's were highly aligned on goals and processes. 
As time went on, the need for consultancy between the two became less as well.

**What I learned as the Tech Lead**
I've been asked a few times if I would consider a Team Lead position but I haven't wanted to remove myself from the codebase just yet. 
I very much enjoy still building software, and I'm fully aware that Team Lead roles take you away from the code, at least in a mid-sized company and up (my preferred company sizes).
I've also been inside many teams where a Technical Team Lead could be absent from the team for hours and days and though a Senior Developer is perfectly capable of making a tactical decision, they may be missing context in  overall strategy (either by their choice or due to culture).
in addition, I personally gained a lot of insight from working with someone who had more experience with the other aspects of the business. It was incredibly insightful to get feedback on how I was coming across, where I needed to be clearer and what certain situations truly meant (translating 'business speak').
I am a better leader for it.

**Where would you use this?**

Not all organisations would require this set-up or would benefit but ours did. 
In smaller teams where the management aspect is smaller and the Technical Team Lead does not mind coding at least 50% of the time
(I've been told so many times about 60/40 or 80/20 spilts, I know how this works...), a split would probably be a burden than a help.
Certainly small organisations could benefit from a coach but your Tech Lead can probably handle Team Lead responsibilities with some training (if they don't have experience).
Mid-size (over 20 developers in my opinion) and up could certainly benefit from this set-up as the technical work demands attention and you're likely to have more associate to mid-level engineers than you are juniors (growth effect).
Also if the technical work is very demanding, it's can be very difficult for a Technical Lead to keep up with Technical Strategy, code quality and a high-level of engagement with each team member.
It's also useful:
        - in difficult teams that are not quite working well together
        - you have a talented Technical Leader but they don't want to line manage.
        - you have immature developers who are technically gifted but need guidance on working within a team and taming their ego.
        
**What about an actual Coach or Scrum Master?**

Having worked with Scrum Masters and Developer Coaches, the immediate difference here is accountability. 
I know this can be a touchy subject but to make it simple - Scrum masters and technical or process coaches
are there temporarily to improve a way of working, skill set, etc and then leave once some metric has been reached.
The best Scrum masters I've met, have said to me, 
"if I do my job well enough, you won't need me anymore". This is great, sometimes you just need them to get things
back on track. But _this_ coach is not a temporary team member with a short term directive.
They are just as accountable for the team's performance as the actual team is.
Personally this leads to trust with the team - this person is everyone's line manager at the end off the day.

**So they took over all the admin while you did the fun stuff?**

This is feedback I received after presenting this topic in a talk. It amused me because the sentiment was similar 
to the complaints made by the old Team Leads, and other Team Leads I've worked with before. 
But I would warn against thinking about it like this. This distribution of work does not take away from the fact 
that the Tech Lead should be as informed about the teams' overall functionality, progress, delivery, etc as they 
would be if they were also the Team Lead. Visa versa, the Team Lead needs to understand the technical strategy, 
constraints, skill requirements, as well as the Tech Lead does, even if they can't implement.  

**Don't senior++ engineers cover this?**

My experience of working with Staff or Principal Engineers is, although they have a big impact on technical strategy (which our Tech Leads
managed along with the Senior VP of Tech), they usually do not reside on a team and are not directly responsible for looking after products.
Although I have no doubt that these roles variy widely across organisations, this is my current experience. There can also be multiple engineers at this 
level, which brings us back to the tie-breaker problem. The Tech Lead is the tie-breaker and if done skillfully, hard feelings can be avoided.
I don't see this role as being in contrast to grades as it is more of a role than a grade.

**An option**

Having a Coach and Captain won't suit every team, never-mind every business, but it provides an alternative team leadership set-up, where 
the right combination of skills can result in a team whose people are not affected by an over-loaded Technical Team Lead,
virtually guarantees continuity of communication & productivity and provides another avenue for developing Developers into Leaders
by showing them and coaching them, rather than it simply being the next career step and having them go in blind.
Personally, the experience changed my life, and ultimately made me a better leader and engineer.
