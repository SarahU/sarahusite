This is the first in a 4-part series where I talk about what a Data Strategy is, how to identify a lack of or poor data 
strategy in a business and it's systems, how to avoid those problems and what to do if you're already experiencing them 
and how to get out of data choas, into data clarity.

I've worked in data and reporting since the beginning of my career (2011), and particularly, in the last 3 years,
I've worked with, consulted with or heard from through the developer grape-vine, about problems that 
A - Big Data was supposed to have solved but didn't, and
B - a set of consistent complaints and problems companies are experiencing with their data. 

So while some of these problems have been around for a while, some are new, and the fancy new Big Data tools are not solving them.
Indeed, it is a combination of tooling, process and culture that will solve our data problems. This should not be too
surprising. Let's get into it some details about those 3 things in this series. First we'll be looking at what symptoms occur with 
people in organisations solving data problems.

If you work with data in some capacity, you've likely to have heard these phrases from others (or yourself) before:

These are identifiers that you can look for in your data systems:

Tools like BigQuery enable companies to rapidly collect, store and query large swathes of data but the tool alone, as with any tools,
is not a sustainable way to go about managing and evolving your data. It alone does not solve the above problems.
In our next section we'll look at what a Data Strategy is and start to look at how to solve these problems.
